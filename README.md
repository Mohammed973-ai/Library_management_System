# Library_management_System
A comprehensive SQL-based library management system demonstrating end-to-end database development, from conceptual design to advanced analytics.

## Project Overview
This project showcases the complete implementation of a Library Management System using SQL, covering database design, data modeling,
ETL processes, and business intelligence reporting for library operations.

## Key Implementation Phases
__1. Data Modeling & Normalization__
* Performed database normalization to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity
* Designed a fully normalized relational schema across six interconnected tables
* Applied normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to optimize data structure

__2. Database Design & Implementation__

* Created comprehensive table structures with appropriate data types
* Implemented data integrity using db constraints (Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Check Constraints)
* Developed database objects including stored procedures for automated operations to enhance integrity
* Designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize table relationships and dependencies

__3. ETL Process__

* Extracted data from source files
* Transformed and cleaned data to meet database requirements
* Loaded processed data into the database ready for analysis

__4. Database Schema__
The system manages six core entities:

employees - Staff information and branch assignments
members - Library member profiles and registration data
books - Book inventory with categories, pricing, and availability status
Branch - Branch locations with manager assignments and contact details
issued_status - Book issue transaction records
return_status - Book return records and tracking


## 1. Data Modeling & Normalization

* There were 6 excel files 1 for each entity so I drew these entities and checked their normal form degree
